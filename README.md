# Implementation of breast cancer prediction using machine learning techniques.

The second major cause of female cancer death, which can be classed as Benign or Malignant, is breast cancer that is the most common invasive cancer in women. Breast cancer research and prevention has in recent years drawn more researchers' attention. The creation of data mining procedures on the other hand offers an efficient way to obtain more useful information from the complex database; according to the information retrieved, some forecasts, classifications and clusters are possible.In this study five different classification models, among which Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) & Logistic Regression (LR) will be used to classify two different breast cance-related datasets to investigate the connection between breast cancer and some attributes to reduce breast cancer death probability (WBCD).The performance of these 5 classification models is compared through three indicators namely predictive accuracy values, F-measure metric and AUC values. Comparative experimental analyzes show that random forest models can work better and adjust better than four other approaches. The model in this trial is therefore accepted in practical applications to have clinical and reference values.
